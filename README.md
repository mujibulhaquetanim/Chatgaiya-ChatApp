# Tech Used

**Client:** React JS

**Database:** Mongo DB

## How to run locally
**As for security reason, it's a common practice that no one upload their crusial credentials and dotenv file.
So, for using it,create a dotenv file in main directory(chatgaiya-chatapp/) and put essential references like,**

```
  MONGO_URI=
  PORT=5000
  JWT_SECRET=mujib71
  NODE_ENV=production
```
 
 after equal sign paste your secret values without any spaces. As of now, you understood that you need to make a mongodb atlas account and a cluster for URI, if you're a beginner then you could use online help

```
